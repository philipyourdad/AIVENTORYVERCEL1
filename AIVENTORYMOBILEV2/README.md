# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

Network Configuration
When connecting to a local backend server, you need to update the IP address in the API configuration:
Find your computer's IP address:
Windows: Open Command Prompt → type ipconfig → look for "IPv4 Address"
Mac: Open Terminal → type ifconfig → look for "inet" under your Wi-Fi adapter
Update the IP address in services/api.js:
Locate the file: AIVENTORYMOBILEV2/services/api.js
Change the baseURL to use your computer's IP address:
javascript
baseURL: 'http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:5001/api'
- Example: http://192.168.1.100:5001/api
Make sure both your computer and mobile device are on the same Wi-Fi network
Restart the mobile app after making changes
